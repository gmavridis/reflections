How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Examining just the code that changed reduced the amount of code i had to look through. 
(I just compared 10 lines instead of a few hundrets)
So I had less work to do - which is big plus on its own - and i could also concentrate all the time 
working on it.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

 - I can reflect on my process of code generation trying to improve this later on
 - I can look how a specific feature was created originaly
 - I can refactor freely without the feat that i cant go back at any time



 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pros:
- Only coherent versions get into the version-control
- You have to intensionally "finish" some step of work
- you get a meaningfull log

cons:
- You might lose your changes if you "leave" in hurry
