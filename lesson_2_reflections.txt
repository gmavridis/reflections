What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it creates a bunch of files in the sub-directory .git which will be used to store the data you will track in your repository


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It "collects"  the elements for your next commit, so if for example you refactor some Code which affects more than one file, you could commit all files with one commit(-message)
